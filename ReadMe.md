In this repository I impemented dimensionaly reduction algorythm called Principal component analysis(PCA)

This repository consits of 3 jpynb files:
    - PCA-2-Features (where i build PCA for 2 features)
    - PCA-N-Features (where i build PCA for N features)
    - PCA-Class (where i build generalized PCA class)


My implementation is not correct in 100% but still works fine.
