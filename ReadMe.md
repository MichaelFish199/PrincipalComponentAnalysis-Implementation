# PrincipalComponentAnalysis-Implementation
Implementation of PCA in python

This repository consits of 3 jpynb files:
- PCA-2-Features (where i build PCA for 2 features)
- PCA-N-Features (where i build PCA for N features)
- PCA-Class (where i build generalized PCA class)


My implementation is not correct in 100% but still works fine.
